**Idea Title:** Development of Funds Based on ETF Analysis and Prediction of Stocks

**Idea Overview:**  
Utilizing historical quarterly data of individual stocks within a specific sector (semiconductors), machine learning techniques will be applied to predict the data for the upcoming quarters. Using these predicted data, time series analysis will be employed to select stocks within the sector that meet the criteria. These selected stocks will form a portfolio, creating a unique ETF product which will be developed and launched.

**Proposal Background and Objectives:**  
This methodology, applicable across various sectors, has been specifically applied to the semiconductor sector, which is one of South Korea's key industries and plays a significant global role. The active growth of the semiconductor industry serves as an exemplary model. Out of 134 stocks listed in the semiconductor sector on KOSPI and KOSDAQ, 46 stocks included in three large ETFs were selected. Based on this selection, a portfolio will be constructed through data analysis and prediction. The purpose of this proposal is to suggest the development of an innovative investment product, providing investors with a unique opportunity.
